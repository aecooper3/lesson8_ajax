### Project Description:
In assignment 8, we used our new knowledge of jQuery and AJAX methods to create
a web application similar to IMDb. To do this, we used a third party server - TMDb.
From TMDb, we gathered JSON data which we then parsed in order to return the info
for a movie searched on our application.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. API is a programmatic interface that uses HTTP methods to return data from 
third parties in JSON or XML.
2. Ajax can be used to update data on a web page without the web page having to 
reload. This happens in four steps - a request is created, sent, received from 
the server containing the requested data, and processed to be incorporated in 
the app.
3. JSON is a subset of JavaScript, as it is a particular syntax used for storing
and exchanging data. JSON is often the return type of an API.
